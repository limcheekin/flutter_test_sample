# flutter_test_sample

The Flutter Test Sample project was created based on [How to test a Flutter app](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-app-testing/) Codelab.

In addition, I added [run Flutter tests using GitHub Actions and Codecov](https://damienaicheh.github.io/flutter/github/actions/2021/05/06/flutter-tests-github-actions-codecov-en.html).

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
